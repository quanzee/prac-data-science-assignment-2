Description of attributes (variables)


Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1 - volatile_acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3): the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

2 - free_sulfur_dioxide (mg / dm^3): the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

3 - total_sulfur_dioxide (mg / dm^3): amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

4 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

5 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm^3): a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

6 - alcohol (\% by volume): the percent alcohol content of the wine


Output variable (based on sensory data): 

7 - quality: score between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent)
